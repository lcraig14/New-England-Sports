    The Boston Red Sox are the oldest New England sports team since they were founded<br />
    in 1901. The Red Sox have played at Fenway Park since 1912 and is one of the <br />
    most historic and recognizable stadiums in baseball. The Red Sox have won 8 MLB<br />
    World Series. Greats like Babe Roth and Ted Williams are two of the biggest contributors<br />
    to making the Red Sox so historic. They both had unbelievable careers.
