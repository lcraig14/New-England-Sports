  The Boston Celtics were founded in 1946 as one of the first NBA teams. The Celtics have the<br />
  most championships in the NBA with 17. 13 out of the Celtics 17 championships came before 1980<br />
  and modern basketball. The Boston Celtics struggled to compete for most of the 90's and early to mid 2000's.<br />
  Celtics General Manager Danny Ainge revived the Celtics franchise in 2008 when he paired up<br />
  3 superstars and brought a championship back to Boston. The Celtics have been competing <br />
  since their resurgence. Bill Russell(played in the 50's and 60's) and Larry Bird<br />
  (played in the late 70', all the 80's, and early 90's) and two of the best players all time<br />
  and brought many championships to Boston.</p>
